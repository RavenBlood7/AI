\section{Question 1: Esolang}
According to esolang \cite{esolang}, an esoteric programming language, or esolang, is a computer programming language that is designed to experiment with peculiar ideas and to be a joke, rather than for practical use. The word \textit{esoteric} means "likely to be understood by only a small number of people\cite{wikipedia}." This implies that such a language would only be understood by a small number of developers. 
\section{Question 2: Views on Esoteric languages}
	\subsection{for}
	potentials
		creative thinking
		expression
		reach new ways of programming that may aid in future
	expression of an art
	tests the boundaries of computer science
	
	\subsection{against}
	list some really silly ones
	seems like waste of time
	unstructured means informal means one could have spent the time doing something more focused
	list costs
\section{Question 3: Practical Examples}
